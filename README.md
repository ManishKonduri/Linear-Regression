## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
    -   To identify the variables affecting demand of sharing the bikes etc.

    -  To create a linear model that quantitatively relates bike counts with variables such as temperature, months, years, days, ..

    - To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict bike counts
